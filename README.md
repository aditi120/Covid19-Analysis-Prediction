# 🦠 COVID-19 Capstone Data Science Project


## 📌 Overview

This capstone project explores the global impact of COVID-19 using data science techniques. The goal is to perform data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the pandemic trends across different countries and timelines.

The project uses a combination of Python libraries to preprocess data, analyze key variables, and visualize patterns in the spread and containment of COVID-19.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📊 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handled missing values, renamed columns for clarity, converted data types, and structured the dataset for analysis.

- 🌍 **Global and Country-Level Analysis**  
  Comparative statistics between countries for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

- 📈 **Time-Series Trend Analysis**  
  Tracked the progression of the pandemic over time using line plots and cumulative graphs.

- 🗺️ **Visualizations**  
  Used libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` for high-quality interactive plots and heatmaps.
