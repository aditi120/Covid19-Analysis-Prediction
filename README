# 🦠 COVID-19 Capstone Data Science Project


## 📌 Overview

This capstone project explores the global impact of COVID-19 using data science techniques. The goal is to perform data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the pandemic trends across different countries and timelines.

The project uses a combination of Python libraries to preprocess data, analyze key variables, and visualize patterns in the spread and containment of COVID-19.
